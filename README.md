# freeCodeCamp Algorithm Scripting Solutions

In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I consolidated the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
The course included a number of challenges that escalated in difficulty and ended in a series of projects to complete to gain the certification. This repo contains my solutions to these challenges.
