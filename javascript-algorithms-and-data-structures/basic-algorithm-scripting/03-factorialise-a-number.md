## Factorialise a Number

Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

### Examples

factorialize(5);
// should return 120
```

```javascript
factorialize(10);
// should return 3628800
```

```javascript
factorialize(0);
// should return 1
```
